Trinidad hotdeploy extension
======

# DESCRIPTION

Extension to allow Trinidad to redeploy an application each time a file, for instance tmp/restart.txt, is modified without restarting Tomcat.

[WARNING] This extension only works with Trinidad 0.9.0 or avobe.

# INSTALL

    $ jruby -S gem install trinidad_hotdeploy_extension

# CONFIGURE

To configure it, we need to add it into the extensions section of a web application in the Trinidad's configuration file.

http://wiki.github.com/calavera/trinidad/advanced-configuration

It also allows to configure the name of the file to monitorize and the period of time that it waits between each check.
